Goal: 
To develop REST APIs to perform the following:
1) API that accepts the products.xlsx as input and store them in DB. 
   Validations: SKU, Name and Brand are mandatory values. SKU should be unique in DB. 
   If validation failed for an entry, abort & stop import and report the last error. 
   Note that the file has only few entries, but the code is expected to handle 100s of entries. 
2) API that allows to search for products. Search filters can be one or more of: SKU, Name, Brand, Package. Response will be the list of matching products.

All input and output will be in JSON format.
APIs should return success response with required data if successfully processed. Else, failure response with appropriate error details.

Package expected:
1) The final code zip or repository url.
2) Instructions to run the code.
3) The target URLs for both the APIs with the available input params. If possible, "Postman" collection for the same would be great.
4) One snapshot of the output from your API testing.

Expectations from code:
1) We are looking for efficient and good quality code.
2) Unit tests to be written.
3) Error scenarios to be handled.
